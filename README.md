# üé® Blender Shader Application (React + TypeScript + Vite)

This repository hosts a web-based shader application designed to seamlessly integrate with Blender objects. It provides a real-time environment for viewing and editing GLSL shaders, allowing for dynamic updates on 3D models.

## ‚ú® Features

This application is divided into two main panels:

### Left Panel (3D Viewport)

- **Three.js-powered 3D Rendering**: Experience smooth and interactive 3D visualizations.
- **Blender Object Loading**: Easily import your 3D models with support for common formats (`.glb`).
- **Animated 3D Objects**: See your shaders come to life on animated models with real-time updates.

### Right Panel (Shader Editor)

- **Split View Editor**: Dedicated editors for both **vertex** and **fragment** shaders, allowing for focused development.
- **Real-time Editing**: Edit your shader code in a clean, monospace font environment.
